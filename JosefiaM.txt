Hi! My name is Vanessa.

Three words that describe me :
1) Cautious
2) Indolent
3) Ravenous

All I do is sit on the couch and watch
T.V. Sometimes I like going to Wal-
Mart during the late hours because 
that's the most intersting time
to go. 

I don't like animals but I do love 
insects and I have my own 
ant farm.

Favorite food is Thai!
